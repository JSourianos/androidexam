### The Worlds Top Rated (fake) Crypto Exchange
- This application is our exam delivery for the course Android Programming (PGR208). It is an application which lists cryptocurrencies from coincap.io. You can click on a certain cryptocurrency, and choose whether to buy it, or sell it if you own it. If you choose to buy, you will be sent to a screen where you can enter the amount of crypto you wish to purchase.

- If you own a cryptocurrency and wish to sell it, you will be sent to a screen which shows your current holding amount (how much crypto you currently own), and then an field where you can enter the amount you wish to sell. The sell button is disabled if you do not own the amount of crypto you have specified. If you buy a coin, a toast message will appear and tell you the amount you have bought, as well as the total price. If you sell, the toast will show the amount of coins you sold and the total price of the sale.
- At the top of the application you can view your current user points in USD. If you click on the yellow navbar, you will be sent to a screen which shows your current portfolio, as well as your user points again in USD. It also shows the actual amount of crypto you own. If you click on the transactions button at the bottom of the screen, you will be sent to a screen showing your previous transactions.
- The transactions page will display each unique transaction. If you buy crypto, the text to the right will be green to symbolize a purchase, and if you sell - the text to the right will be red, to symbolize a sell. These colors are used in real stock and crypto-exchanges, so it fits nicely into our application as well. The text also displays a text telling you if you bought or sold a cryptocurrency in the specific transaction. It also displays the date and time of purchase.
